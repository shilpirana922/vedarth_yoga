<p>As per Indian traditional sciences, our Bodies are made up of Five Elements (Pancha Bhutas).</p>
<ol>
<li>Space / Akasa : it is emptiness to accommodate anything that comes in, e.g. space in cavities /bladders, blood vessels, lungs, stomach, intestines, heart, and intracellular space. Attributes of Space are size and shape and shabda (sound)</li>
<li>Air / Vayu : movement of anything reflects Vayu. Movements of blood, food, lungs, heart, musculo-skeletal movement of any part of the body, expulsion of wastes / toxins, movement of vital energy through meridians, even prana leaving the body at the time of death â€“ all these are due to actions of Vayu only. Attributes of Vayu are speed and sparsha (touch)</li>
<li>Fire / Agni : Heat in the body, digestive fire, most of the chemicals produced by brain, glands and lever are regarded as fire. Its attributes are sharpness, brightness and Rupa (sight)</li>
<li>Water / Jala : fluids or fluidity is water element. Its attributes are soft, cohesive, heavy and Rasa (taste)</li>
<li>Earth / Prithvi : Solid matter, i.e. any tissue is earth. Its attributes are heaviness, inertia / stability, hard and Gandha (smell)</li>
</ol>
<p>The ratio of these five elements vary slightly, person to person, which decides the constitution (tatva) of the person. Though it is decided by birth, some change will be there with the age.</p>
<p>When the Air element is a little more dominant, then they are Vata constitution.</p>
<p>When the Fire element is a little more dominant, then they are Pitta constitution.</p>
<p>When the Earth and water are a little more dominant, then they are Kapha constitution.</p>
<p>Ayurvdic doctors, who are experienced in pulse diagnosis (Nadi Pariksha), can identify the constitution of the body very accurately. Based on the physical appearance and mental qualities also, you can identify the constitution. As there will be some mix up of physical and mental parameters, and changes due to age and individual evolutionary level, our judgement will be less accurate. However, it is good enough to assess how much physical workout they need to do and what to avoid / favour in diet; to stay healthy.</p>
<p>See the articles on Vata, Pitta and Kapha to understand the qualities and dietetics.</p>
