<ul>
<li>Warrior 1 and 2 , Supported Triangle, Chair pose</li>
<li>Balancing poses like Vrikshasana and Warrior 3 should be practised with props like wall and chair respectively</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pregnancy is a beautiful chapter in the expecting parents’ life; one, that is cherished forever as in the end there is a tiny bundle of joy waiting to be taken home.

Yogic techniques have numerous benefits for the health of the mother and the growing fetus. Gone are the days when elective C-sections were the choice of delivery for many. Women, now are aware that a normal child birth will help them heal faster &#8211; it is the natural way.</p>
<p>A typical prenatal Yoga class consists of restorative asana flows with increased focus on breath to gently stretch and relax in a calm setting.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Author : Dr. Nidhi Khurana, Bodhi Certified Yoga Trainer, USA</p>
<h2><strong>Yoga for Thyroid imbalance:</strong></h2>
<p>Yoga is capable of restoring the normal activity of the organs. Yoga could actually be your “mantra” to rectify some glitches in your bodily functions if practiced regularly. It stimulates the organs in the body and hence influences their functions. Yoga definitely counteracts thyroid imbalance in our body when combined with a proper diet. The following asanas can help with thyroid imbalance:</p>
<p><strong>Sarvangasana (shoulder stand):</strong> This asana stimulates the thyroid gland because of the pressure of the chest against the chin. It balances the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems.</p>
<p><strong>Vipareeta Karani (Inverted pose):</strong> Like Sarvangasana, it directs the blood flow to the upper body and stimulates the thyroid gland.</p>
<p><strong>Janu Sirashasana (head to knee pose) :</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matsyasana (Fish pose):</strong> It regulates the function of the thyroid gland and boosts the immune system by stimulating the thymus gland.</p>
<p><strong>Halasana (Plough pose):</strong> This asana massages all the internal organs, activates the digestion, relieving constipation, promotes the production of insulin, and regulates the thyroid gland function.</p>
<p><strong>Marjariasana (Cat stretch):</strong> This asana improves the flexibility of neck, shoulders, and spine. It gives relief from menstrual cramps and also tones the female reproductive organs.</p>
<p><strong>Ustrasana (Camel pose):</strong> This asana involves stretching of the neck backward which exerts the pressure on the thyroid gland and thus helps stimulating it.</p>
<p><strong>Bhujangasana (Cobra pose):</strong> It stimulates the function of the thyroid gland and also relieves a backache.</p>
<p><strong>Setubandhasana (Bridge pose):</strong> This asana diverts the blood flow to the thyroid gland and regulates its activity.</p>
<p><strong>Shavasana (Corpse pose):</strong> It relaxes the whole body and calms the mind. This asana increases the body awareness and helps restore the vital functions in the body.</p>
<p>The asanas listed above all stimulate the thyroid gland (except Shavasana) and hence are beneficial in case of hypothyroidism. For hyperthyroidism, the asanas which relax the body and do not put pressure on the thyroid gland are recommended like Vajrasana (child pose), Shavasana (corpse pose). Breathing techniques (Pranayama) are more helpful in case of hyperthyroidism like Brahmari pranayama, Nadi-shodan pranayama, and cooling pranayamas like sheetali and sheetkari.</p>
<p>It is inevitable to get trapped in the claws of fatal diseases and disorders when we don’t pay attention to our body. Our negligence to small things lead to bigger consequences. However, a sincere care can make us whole again so why not take a leap and lead a healthy life!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;">PCOD is not a disease  !</span></span></strong></h3>
<p>With the change in our lifestyle and increased stress levels, 1 in 10 women is diagnosed with PCOD. PCOD is short for Polycystic Ovary Disorder is a prevalent disorder in the women of reproductive age. The underlying cause of PCOD is a hormonal imbalance which occurs due to a variety of reasons like unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits, anxiety, stress, and depression. Women with this disorder have an irregular menstrual cycle and higher levels of male hormones “androgens” due to which it contributes to infertility. Due to higher levels of male hormones, these women can experience acne and excess hair growth on the upper lip, chin, and on the lower abdomen. PCOD can result in increased insulin resistance thereby leading to an increased risk of developing Type2 diabetes. Weight gain is one of the consequences of PCOD which leads to obesity. Unfortunately, women with this disorder also have great difficulty in losing weight.</p>
<h3><strong>Foods to be included in diet:</strong></h3>
<p>High fiber foods are highly recommended for women diagnosed with PCOD like, millets and multigrain flour.</p>
<p>Green leafy vegetables are a source of vitamins and rich in iron, calcium, potassium which contribute towards managing the symptoms of PCOD like improved thyroid functioning which is crucial for better hormone balance.</p>
<p>Colored vegetables and fruits are high in antioxidant and act against the harmful effects of stress.</p>
<p>Foods with high omega three fatty acids like nuts.</p>
<p>Goods with low Glycemic Index: High levels of sugar aggravate the condition and are a big “no-no.” Implement your diet with non-starchy vegetables, beans, sprouts, and lentils.</p>
<p><strong>Foods to avoid:</strong> Canned juices, sweetened drinks, sodas, starchy vegetables like potatoes, and corn. Refined sugar and processed foods like pasta, white bread, cookies, cakes, and potato chips.</p>
<h3><strong>Yoga: A remedy for PCOD</strong></h3>
<p>We know that yoga is a unified form of exercise which works on our whole body. From weight loss to stress handling, Yoga can keep our body and mind in shape. The following are some asanas which prove beneficial to cure or prevent PCOD:</p>
<p><strong>Baddha konasana</strong> (Bound Angle Pose): This asana stimulates abdomen, ovaries, bladder, and improves blood circulation in the lower abdomen organs. It gives relief from mild depression, anxiety, and irregular menstruation.</p>
<p><strong>Bhujangasana</strong> (Cobra pose): This asana improves and deepens breathing. It tones the ovaries and the uterus, helps in menstrual disorders, stimulates appetite, alleviates constipation, and is beneficial for all the abdominal organs.</p>
<p><strong>Naukasana</strong> (Boat pose): It strengthens the abdominal muscles and spine, stimulates thyroid gland and kidneys, thereby relieving stress and improving digestion.</p>
<p><strong>Ardha Matsyendra asana</strong> (Seated Half Spinal Twist): This asana is an answer for infertility as it massages and hence stimulates the lower abdomen organs and even decreases menstrual discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>Padmasana</strong> (Lotus pose): It stimulates organs in the abdomen, bladder and most importantly calms the brain. Its benefits included natural childbirth and decreased menstrual discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>Marjari pose</strong> (Cat stretch): This dynamic asana massages spine, belly, and internal organs and hence aids in digestion.</p>
<p><strong>Parsarita Padottanasana</strong> (Wide leg stretch with forwarding bend): It strengthens the spine, and tones the abdominal organs. Stimulates the blood circulation to the brain and hence calms the mind and relieves stress.</p>
<p><strong>Chakki Chalanasana</strong> (Churning the mill): This asana is excellent for toning the nerves and organs of the pelvis and abdomen. It is beneficial for regulating the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Nauka Sanchalanasana</strong> (Rowing the boat): It has a positive effect on the pelvis and abdomen and releases energy blockages in these areas. It is especially useful for gynecological disorders like PCOD and also removes constipation.</p>
<p><strong>Supta Udarakarshanasana</strong> (Sleeping abdominal stretch pose): This asana stretches the abdominal muscles and organs and hence improves digestion.</p>
<p><strong>Matsyasana</strong> (Fish pose): This asana stretches the intestines and abdominal organs and is useful for all intestinal disorders. It regulates the thyroid gland, and the blood circulation is diverted to the pelvic organs due to the pressure of the feet on the thighs.</p>
<p><strong>Shavasana</strong> (Corpse pose): It relaxes the complete body and calms the mind. It relieves stress and increases body awareness.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;">PCOD is not a disease that needs a cure but a disorder which requires a severe lifestyle change to get rid of it. A lifestyle which involves regular exercise and healthy eating can keep you away as well as can help you be freed from this terrible disorder. </span></h3>
