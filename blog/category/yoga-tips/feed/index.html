<h2><strong>Yoga for Thyroid imbalance:</strong></h2>
<p>Yoga is capable of restoring the normal activity of the organs. Yoga could actually be your “mantra” to rectify some glitches in your bodily functions if practiced regularly. It stimulates the organs in the body and hence influences their functions. Yoga definitely counteracts thyroid imbalance in our body when combined with a proper diet. The following asanas can help with thyroid imbalance:</p>
<p><strong>Sarvangasana (shoulder stand):</strong> This asana stimulates the thyroid gland because of the pressure of the chest against the chin. It balances the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems.</p>
<p><strong>Vipareeta Karani (Inverted pose):</strong> Like Sarvangasana, it directs the blood flow to the upper body and stimulates the thyroid gland.</p>
<p><strong>Janu Sirashasana (head to knee pose) :</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matsyasana (Fish pose):</strong> It regulates the function of the thyroid gland and boosts the immune system by stimulating the thymus gland.</p>
<p><strong>Halasana (Plough pose):</strong> This asana massages all the internal organs, activates the digestion, relieving constipation, promotes the production of insulin, and regulates the thyroid gland function.</p>
<p><strong>Marjariasana (Cat stretch):</strong> This asana improves the flexibility of neck, shoulders, and spine. It gives relief from menstrual cramps and also tones the female reproductive organs.</p>
<p><strong>Ustrasana (Camel pose):</strong> This asana involves stretching of the neck backward which exerts the pressure on the thyroid gland and thus helps stimulating it.</p>
<p><strong>Bhujangasana (Cobra pose):</strong> It stimulates the function of the thyroid gland and also relieves a backache.</p>
<p><strong>Setubandhasana (Bridge pose):</strong> This asana diverts the blood flow to the thyroid gland and regulates its activity.</p>
<p><strong>Shavasana (Corpse pose):</strong> It relaxes the whole body and calms the mind. This asana increases the body awareness and helps restore the vital functions in the body.</p>
<p>The asanas listed above all stimulate the thyroid gland (except Shavasana) and hence are beneficial in case of hypothyroidism. For hyperthyroidism, the asanas which relax the body and do not put pressure on the thyroid gland are recommended like Vajrasana (child pose), Shavasana (corpse pose). Breathing techniques (Pranayama) are more helpful in case of hyperthyroidism like Brahmari pranayama, Nadi-shodan pranayama, and cooling pranayamas like sheetali and sheetkari.</p>
<p>It is inevitable to get trapped in the claws of fatal diseases and disorders when we don’t pay attention to our body. Our negligence to small things lead to bigger consequences. However, a sincere care can make us whole again so why not take a leap and lead a healthy life!!</p>

<p>శరీర తత్వాన్నిబట్టి ప్రతీ శరీరానికీ ఆరోగ్యవంతమైన బరువు వేరువేరుగా ఉంటుంది. మన శరీరాలు ముఖ్యంగా మూడు తత్వాలు &#8211; వాత, పిత్త, కఫ</p>
<p>వాత తత్వంలో వాయు మహాభూతం కొంచెం ఎక్కువ ఉత్తేజంతో ఉంటుంది. శరీరాలు తేలికగా, అంటే సన్నగా ఉంటాయి.</p>
<p>పిత్త తత్వంలో అగ్ని మహాభూతం కొంచెం ఎక్కువ ఉత్తేజంతో ఉంటుంది. శరీరాలు సమంగా ఉంటాయి.</p>
<p>కఫ తత్వంలో పృథ్వి, జల మహాభూతాలు కొంచెం ఎక్కువ ఉత్తేజంతో ఉంటాయి. శరీరాలు బరువుగాను, పెద్దగాను/ లావుగాను ఉంటాయి.</p>
<p>కఫ తత్వంవారు బరువు పెరగడానికి ఏదైనా చేయాల్సిన అవసరం ఎన్నటికీ రాదు. పిత్త తత్వంవారికి, ఆరోగ్యం సమ స్థితిలో ఉన్నప్పుడు, బరువు, ఆకృతి కూడా సమ స్థితిలో ఉంటాయి. వీరు సన్నగా ఉన్నారంటే, అది పోషకాల లోపం వల్ల గాని, అనారోగ్యం వలనగాని మాత్రమే.</p>
<p>వాత తత్వంవారు సాధారణంగా సన్నగా ఉంటారుగాని, ఈక్రింది చిట్కాలను పాటిస్తే, పుష్ఠిగా ఉండగలరు.</p>
<p>1 . తేలికపాటి వ్యాయామం &#8211; వారానికి 5 రోజులు, లేదా మధ్య స్థాయి వ్యాయామం &#8211; వారానికి 3 రోజులు, లేదా సాత్విక యోగ &#8211; వారానికి 5 రోజులు.</p>
<p>2 . సరియైన ఆహార నియమాలు &#8211; వేళకు సాత్విక ఆహారం భోంచేయడం, రోజుకు 4 &#8211; 5 లీటర్ల నీరు తాగడం.</p>
<p>3 . ఉదయాన్నే, ఒక గుప్పెడు, రాత్రంతా నానిన వేరుశనగ గింజలు తినాలి. బాగుగా నమలడం చాలా ముఖ్యం.</p>
<p>4 . ప్రతీ రోజూ, పృథ్వీ ముద్రలో 15 నిముషాలు, చిన్ముద్రలో 5 నిముషాలు కూర్చోవాలి.</p>
<p>5 . బాగా నిద్ర పోవాలి. ( see the article “are you fighting with bed” for guidelines)</p>
<p>6 . ఆహార సంతులనానికి, పప్పు ధాన్యాల మొలకలకంటే, నానబెట్టిన బాదాములు, కొబ్బరి చాలా మంచివి.</p>
<p>7 . ఎల్లప్పుడూ ఈ సంకల్పం చెప్పుకుంటూ ఉండండి. &#8211; ముఖ్యంగా నిద్ర పోయే ముందు, నిద్ర లేచిన వెంటనే.</p>
<p>అ) నేను ఆరోగ్యంగా ఉన్నాను.</p>
<p>ఆ) నేను మంచి శరీరాకృతిని కలిగి ఉన్నాను.</p>
<p>ఇ) నేను ఉండవలసిన బరువుకి చేరువవుతున్నాను.</p>
<p>పృథ్వీ ముద్ర                                                      చిన్ముద్ర</p>

<p>If you want to put on muscles or embarrassed by your bony structure, this will surely help you.</p>
<p>The healthy weight of each body varies according to the type of the body – Vata, Pitta and Kapha.</p>
<p>Vata  means air element more dominant &#8211; bodies are light</p>
<p>Kapha means earth and water elements are dominant – bodies are heavy</p>
<p>Pitta means fire element more dominant – bodies are medium built.</p>
<p>For kapha people, it will never occur to do anything, to gain weight.</p>
<p>Pitta people are medium built with normal health. If they are too thin, it may be due to some sickness or lack of nutrition. Vata people are usually thin, but can have medium built body, if they follow these tips.</p>
<ol>
<li>Very light exercise for 5 days a week or moderate exercise for three days a week or gentle yoga for 5 days a week.</li>
<li>Follow proper discipline of food (satvik) and water ( 4 to 5 litres a day)</li>
<li>Eat a handful of soaked ground nuts everyday morning – remember chewing well is important.</li>
<li>Sit with Prithvi mudra for 15 minutes and chin mudra for 5 minutes everyday.</li>
<li>Sleep well ( see the article on sleep for guidelines)</li>
<li>Prefer soaked almonds and cocoanuts over lentil sprouts as diet supplement</li>
<li>Always affirm yourself : “ I am healthy, I am in perfect shape, at perfect weight”, especially before sleeping and immediately after waking up.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acidity is a small and very disturbing problem and can cause serious health issues, if ignored. A few simple and effective tips can save you from a lot of discomfort and hospital visits.</p>
<ol>
<li>Chew well. Saliva is alkaline. When we chew the food well, each particle is coated with saliva and food turns into alkaline, which reduces the acidity of the blood</li>
<li>Shift to brown rice. White rice is acidic and brown rice is alkaline.</li>
<li>Wheat: Maida is highly acidic. If you are eating outside food, avoid maida items, including biscuits. Replace them with whole wheat atta items. Wheat is also acidic for South Indians. Prefer millets (Jowar, Bajra, Ragi etc) over wheat.</li>
<li>Sugar is highly acidic. Replace the sugar with jaggery or misri (rock candy – unrefined sugar). Everyday, in large quantities even Jaggery and misri are also not good.</li>
<li>Avoid sour fruits. Citrus fruits like mosambi and santra are ok, but narangi in very limited quantity. A slice of ripe pineapple is ok.</li>
<li>Don’t drink water along with foods – whether solid or liquid, light or heavy – which undergo the process of digestion. Give a gap of 1 to 2 hrs after eating. Water with food will dilute the digestive juices, creating a requirement for more acids. If required, half cup to one cup of hot water is ok, immediately after food.</li>
<li>Over eating will cause gastric acidity. Drink a cup of hot water after feasts. Continue it at every ½ hr, till you feel comfortable in stomach</li>
<li>Irregular timings for food intake (especially for pitta type of people) will result in acidity and ulcers. Minimise irregularity. Under unavoidable conditions, take tender cocoanut water or fruits at proper meal times.</li>
<li>Infections in gut also can create acidity / ulcers. Try natural honey with lukewarm water.</li>
<li>Keep a small piece of Haritaki and swallow the juice for immediate relief from burning in the stomach</li>
<li>Keep Sankha mudra and Prana mudra, each 10 to 15 minutes per day</li>
<li>Soft drinks / soda (carbonated water) are acidic. Replace them with natural fruit juices (without adding sugar or milk)</li>
<li>Strong negative emotions for a long period can cause many serious health issues. Acidity is one among them. Understand the permanent and impermanent aspects of life. Cool yourself with yoga and meditations.</li>
