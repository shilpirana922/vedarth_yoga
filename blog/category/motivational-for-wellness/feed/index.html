				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>చావడానికో</strong> <strong>మంచి</strong> <strong>మార్గం</strong></p>
<p>చచ్చి పోవాలనుందా ? దానికో మంచి మార్గముంది. చావడమూ తేలిక. చస్తూ,కొంత పుణ్యాన్ని సంపాదించి, ఈ కర్మల్ని/అప్పుల్ని కొంతవరకు తీర్చవచ్చు. మీ శరీర భాగాలనన్నింటిని, అవయవ మాఫియాకు అమ్మేయండి. ఆ డబ్బుని అప్పులు తీర్చడానికో / అవసరమైన వారికి దానం చేయడానికో ఉపయోగించండి. మాఫియావాళ్లు, మీ చావు అతి ప్రశాంతంగా, తేలికగా ఉండేటట్లు చూస్తారు. చావు తర్వాత, ఒక ప్రేతాత్మగా అతి భయంకరమైన జీవితాన్ని దాట వేయవచ్చు కూడా.</p>
<p>ఇలా కాకపోతే, ఇదే పరిస్థితుల్ని, మరింత ఉధృతంగా మరుజన్మలో పొందుతారు. శరీరాన్ని చంపుకోగలరు. మనస్సుని చంపడం మీ చేత గాదు. మీరు ప్రస్తుతం ఎదుర్కొంటున్న పరిస్థితులన్నీ, మీ మనస్సు కల్పించిన / ఆహ్వానించిన ఆటే. ఆటను మధ్యలో ఆపలేరు. మరో శరీరం దొరికేదాకా, కొంత సమయాన్ని పొందగలరంతే.</p>
<p>సమయం తీసుకున్నందుకు కట్టాల్సిన వడ్డీతోబాటు, అనేక ఘోర ప్రమాదాలున్నాయి కూడా. రకరకాల దాహాలతోను, ఆకళ్లతోను బాధపడే ప్రేతాత్మగా మారవచ్చు. ఇతరత్రా (హత్యలు, ప్రమాదాలు మొదలైనవి) చనిపోయి తయారైన ప్రేతాత్మల కంటే, ఆత్మహత్యతో తయారైన పిరికి ప్రేతాత్మలు చాలా బలహీనమైనవి. ఆ రౌడీ ఆత్మలు మిమ్మల్ని చాలా క్రూరంగా బాధించ వచ్చు. ఏ భూత మాంత్రికుడో మిమ్మల్ని వశం చేసుకుని, బానిసగా వాడుకోవచ్చు. వర్ణనాతీతమైన పద్ధతుల్లో మిమ్మల్ని దురుపయోగ పరచవచ్చు, బాధించవచ్చు.</p>
<p>ఈ ప్రమాదాలనుంచి తప్పించుకోగల్గినా, మరో భౌతిక శరీరం కోసం, సూక్ష్మ శరీరం (యాతనా శరీరం) తో చాలా కాలం ఎదురు చూడాల్సి రావచ్చు. ఆ కాలమంతా, మీరు తప్పించుకుందామనుకున్నపరిస్థితుల బాధలు అనుభవించాల్సిందే. ఎందుకంటే, ఆ గతం అంతా మీ మనసులో బలంగా నిలిచి పోయింది. సూక్ష్మ లోకంలో ఆలోచనే అనుభవమైపోతుంది. భావాలు (బాధలైనా, ఆనందాలైనా) చాలా గాఢంగానే ఉంటాయి.</p>
<p>మరో శరీరాన్ని పొందినా, అది అంగ వైకల్యంతో ఉండే అవకాశం ఎక్కువ ఉంది. ఎందుకంటే, ఒకసారి ప్రకృతి ప్రసాదించిన అమూల్యమైన వరం- మీ పూర్ణ శరీరం &#8211; దాన్ని మీరు చాలా దారుణంగా తిరస్కరించారు.</p>
<p>పిరికి వాళ్ళకి, భయాలతో ప్రతీ క్షణం చచ్చేకంటే, ఒక్కసారి పూర్తిగా చచ్చిపోవడమే మేలనిపిస్తుంటుంది. (ఔను. మీవన్నీ భయాలే. సమాజానికి మొహం చూపించడానికి భయం. పరిస్థితుల్ని ఎదుర్కొనలేని భయం. అపజయాలు శాశ్వతమనే భయం.) కానీ, భయాలు ఏలోకంలోను మిమ్మల్ని వీడవు.</p>
<p>బయటపడే మార్గముంది. మిమ్మల్ని పట్టించుకోని / మీరు తెలియని చోటుకు వెళ్లి యోగా నేర్చుకోండి. మీరు మహా శక్తి వంతులౌతారు. అమోఘమైన యోగ గురు పరంపర మీకు అండగా ఉంటుంది.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Case: one fully pregnant lady was not getting labour pains even after 38 weeks of pregnancy. The doctor gave her medicine for labour pains. When the pains started, she could not bear them and hence she was given anaesthesia. Because she is in sedation she was not pushing the baby out. The doctors waited for one day. Meanwhile, her water broke down, but the baby did not come out. Then they did caesarean. By then baby got a clot in brain, resulting one side limbs impaired.</p>
<p>Now the baby is growing. Chances are there for the effect of clot also to increase. They have started physio-therapy for the baby. All this could be avoided, had the mother done some yoga, during the pregnancy. What they spend now is much more higher than what it would have costed for prenatal yoga, money as well as time. Baby would have had perfect health, physically as well as mentally, which is invaluable.</p>
<p>Perfect body, health and powerful mind – these are the best gifts you can give to your children by spending some time doing yoga. You gift yourself with joyful pregnancy period, easy &amp; and painless delivery.</p>
<p>Pressures we experience, the diseases we suffer are definitely reflected in the genes of embryo. Yoga for 6 months to one year prior to conception, will make great difference in child’s health &amp; psychology.</p>
<p>And continuing prenatal yoga, after conception will make</p>
<ol>
<li>a) The carrying period much more pleasant, reduced fear of labour pains</li>
<li>b) More healthy, less complications</li>
<li>c) Reduce labour pains, almost nill musculo- skeletal pains</li>
<li>d) Short time labour and easy delivery</li>
<li>e) Healthy growth of baby and healthy mother</li>
<li>f) Strong bondage between baby and mother</li>
<li>g) Active and intelligent baby</li>
<li>h) Less postnatal stress to mother</li>
<li>i) Quick recovery and toning of muscles and so on</li>
</ol>
<p>Two people get injure by accidents, out of 100 insured. Still we don’t mind  paying for accidental risk courage, every year. 36% miscarriages are happening due to various reasons.  10% babies are born with various health issues.</p>
<p>Yoga is much more beyond the insurance. Yoga is your responsibility towards health and happiness of your child.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nature has given us a greatest gift – a nectar pot in our body, and we seldom use it. That nectar is called happy hormone or cuddle hormone or Oxytocin.</p>
<p>After returning from a stressful day, cuddle with your partner for 10 minutes. You are free from stress. Cuddling releases oxytocin. Oxytocin is an amazing natural hormone that does everything from making you feel good to helping you feel connected to others.</p>
<p>Oxytocin has so many benefits for the human body. It’s only natural that all these positive effects are going to release stress, also. You will feel happy, peaceful, loving, more connected with your partner, confident in social situations, your immune system becomes stronger. Cuddling relieves pain, speeds up wound healing, slows down cell-aging and increases life-expectancy, mood stability, one&#8217;s sense of well-being and reduces stress. Cuddling helps deepen your relationships.</p>
<p>In the hypothalamus, oxytocin is made and is stored in pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the pituitary gland. Oxytocin is released in high amounts  during mating, childbirth and lactation to aid reproductive functions.</p>
<p>Oxytocin plays a role in social bonding, sexual reproduction in both sexes, and during and after childbirth. Oxytocin is released into the bloodstream as a hormone in response to stretching of the cervix and uterus during labour, helps shrink the uterus after delivery and with stimulation of the nipples from breastfeeding. This helps with birth, bonding with the baby, and milk production.</p>
<p>Oxytocin has an anti-anxiety effect and may increase romantic attachment and empathy. Manufactured oxytocin is given to people with autism and social phobia to help them face society. When oxytocin is taken in doses or as a spray it causes relaxation and arousal in most men and women.</p>
<p>However, manufactured Oxytocin is misused some times, to induce early puberty among girls who have been dragged into the flesh trade; or to induce quick childbirth; or to extract more milk from the cows; or to increase sizes of vegetables and fruits.</p>
<p>For large quantities of Oxytocin, alternatives to injection or mating are &#8211; Meditation and yoga nidra,  after a systematic yoga session. Experience the bliss which triggers the release of this happy hormone, in our meditation and yoga nidra training programmes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Stress</strong></p>
<p>Stress is like octopus. Its tentacles will hamper all systems of the body. First effected are central nervous system, pineal gland and pituitary gland, with which many functions of body are hampered. Production of hormones by other glands is controlled by Pituitary gland.</p>
<p>Stress will lead to hurried, unmindful overeating and more number of times resulting in too much excess calories, which are converted in to fat.</p>
<p>Stress leads us to sluggishness and thereby resulting in low calories burning.</p>
<p>Stress hampers the desire for coitus. The happy hormones which are produced in coitus make you beautiful / handsome, happy, active and attractive. With less frequent or nil coitus in your thirties and forties, you will look too old and fatty for your age.</p>
<p>Stress gives many other health complications for which you have to undergo medications. Side effects of these medicines are dullness, sleepy and obesity.</p>
<p><strong>Hormonal Imbalance:</strong></p>
<p>Reasons for this are many. Stress is major one among them. Micro nutrients deficiency, late marriages, disturbed sleep rhythms (due to night shifts, TV shows, mobile / social network, addictions, late night parties etc), heavy traffic commuting are a few others, to contribute to hormonal imbalance.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>With low TSH, thyroid stops functioning properly, metabolism decreases, body becomes sluggish and bulges. Thyroid hormone is like a thermostat for weight control.</li>
<li>The ratio of insulin and glucagon produced in pancreas is controlled by Pituitary gland. This ratio determines whether you store fat or burn fat.</li>
<li>Testosterone and HGH are building and burning hormones. HGH increases the bone and muscle mass and simultaneously it decreases the fat stores, thus making you leaner and muscular. Production of these hormones is controlled by Pituitary gland.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Regular Pasting:</strong></p>
<p>Pasting or crash dieting sends a wrong signal to the body, as “ food is scarce. Conserve the energy.”</p>
<p>Then whatever we eat, majority of it is stored in the form of fat. Only a meagre part of it is given to maintaining regular activities of body, which makes the person, very slow (to consume less energy) and fatty.</p>
<p>Drastic reduction on quantity of regular meal also gives the same result. As the craving for food in the mind increases day by day, if at all there is some weight reduction, it is temporary. One day mind will say ‘enough’, and you will pounce on the food.</p>
<p><strong>Tamasic (Junk) Food:</strong></p>
<p>Bakery food, stale food, alcohol etc will make the body and mind dull and lazy. Laziness will lead to weight gain.</p>
<p>No work except watching TV: you have a whole day to watch TV. Yet, while eating also you watch TV. When one sense organ is more active / prioritised, others will become less efficient, and hence, you need more tasty food. If you eat while watching TV, you tend to over eat, because there is no stomach full signal, because mind is engrossed on TV Show.</p>
<p>Over eating, no work, wrong sleep hours are the easy ways for gaining the weight and disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day time Sleep:</strong></p>
<p>After lunch, taking a nap, really recharges, if it is below 20 minutes. More than half an hour day sleep will make the fats very tough to burn and the fat storage is on belly only.</p>
<p>Sick and old people sleep in daytime, as required by them. Pot bellies – result of day sleep – are hard to reduce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Medicinal side effects:</strong></p>
<p>Treatments for problems such as depression, TB, irregular periods and problems which require steroids will surely result in weight gain. Post operative treatments also will result in weight gain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toxin accumulation:</strong></p>
<p>Due to the over use of pesticides in modern farming, our Food (grains, vegetables and fruits) and water contain harmful amounts of pesticide residues. These pesticides penetrate in to the body through digestive system. Because the pesticides are synthetic, lever can not break them. Pesticides (from the air polluted with) can enter even through the lungs and skin. Pesticide molecule holds the fat tissues around it strongly, making it difficult to burn them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ill effects of other treatments: </strong></p>
<p>Some weight loss programs / treatments – to show the quick results, adopt harmful and regenerative methods, due to the lack of proper understanding of cause, or for recurring income. Fat suction is one among them. Starving you with improper diet plans and improper foods will bounce the weight back more strongly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Negative programming:</strong></p>
<p>Some words will have reverse effect on our system. To understand better; tell yourself “ don’t remember the dog”. what happened?. Mind made a picture of dog first and then erased it. Similarly, when you use the words like “ I have to reduce my weight”, mind will send the signal to the body to increase the weight first, so that it will act on the command “to reduce”. Because you are not specifying the limits and you are using the same words again and again, system is trying its best to put on weight. Mind is stronger than the body. Subconscious mind is much more stronger. More repetition of words will take root in subconscious mind, making weight reduction impossible by whatever you do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to commit suicide? There is a better way. Earn some merit to payoff these debts while dying. Sell your whole body parts to Body Organ Mafia. Donate that money to the needy. Also, your death will be peaceful and painless. You may escape worst kind of life after death – as stray spirit.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you have to face same circumstances, with more intensity. You can kill the body. You don’t know how to kill the mind. *The circumstances from which you want to escape now, are created  / invited by your mind only. * you can not quit this game in the middle. You can buy some time, till you get another body.</p>
<p>But, there are lots of dangers in between, apart from the interest for the delay.  ^You may become a stray spirit, suffering with lots of kinds of hungers and thirsts. Coward (suicide) spirits are very weak compared to other (murder / accident) spirits. Those rowdy spirits may torcher you in many heinous ways. Any bhoot  mantrik may catch hold of you to enslave you or abuse you in many undiscribable ways.^</p>
<p>Even if you escape from these dangers also, you may have to wait in astral form for a long time for another body. All that time you will suffer the same circumstances which you wanted to escape, because that past situation is frozen in your mind. In the astral world, thought itself is manifestation; and feelings (pain or pleasure) are more solid and hence more intense.</p>
<p>When you get another body, most likely it will be handicapped, as you have dishonoured the most precious gift of nature – the complete body</p>
<p>For cowards, it may feel like – it is better to die rather than living with fears. (yes. Only fears – nothing else. Fear to face the people / society, fear to take the challenges, fear of failure for ever). But, fears will never leave you.</p>
<p>There is a way to escape. Learn yoga in a place where nobody knows you nor bother you. You will be strengthened. You will have the support of great lineage of yoga teachers.</p>
