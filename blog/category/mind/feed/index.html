				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ‚ÄúMe‚Äù time?? Isn‚Äôt all the time you have just yours as it is for everyone on earth?‚Äù quipped Mom, with a perplexed look, when I complained of the lack of it, after I had my baby girl. Her response didn‚Äôt come without any wisdom in it and it took me a few years to get the depth. As women we always pride ourselves in being excellent multi-taskers- Oh yeah, I see the nod <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> yet have you ever heard our opposite gender ever complain about not having any ‚ÄúMe‚Äù time?? Smile and admit it ‚Äì they rarely do! Of course now are minds are racing against all odds to prove why they don‚Äôt complain‚Ä¶I will let you do that, but not before you finish this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there may be a plethora of reasons you have listed on the Why, the fact remains it is a rare feeling for men. I am least feminist in general &amp; even less in women‚Äôs circles as my personal take is that it‚Äôs an image we want to fall in love with most of the times and satisfy the ‚Äúsense of belonging‚Äù to the elite group of independent, strong willed, fear nothing women we all aspire to be. So I will be just that and point out that we have a thing or two we could borrow from our dear men when it comes to ‚ÄúMe‚Äù Time.</p>
<p>Firstly, ‚ÄúMe‚Äù time need not Always be this secluded, cozy spot you have found yourself to read your favorite author sipping some divine coffee!! Wake up and smell the coffee, now really!! It can be very much part of a regular day in which you beat your alarm in being up, zoom past the morning dailies including packing husband/child/dabbas and helps at home, rush to office, finish the daily dose of banter with colleagues and land in a thud at the office chair only to find yourself drowning in a sea storm of mails and deadlines! Phew, it‚Äôs just 3-4 hours into the day and you would easily trade an arm to get a back and foot massage coz you have achieved so much already! Hah, really? Now rewind and slow down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of each activity accomplished since you woke up and ask yourself &#8211; Was there a single minute where you did any activity in full awareness, aligned with all your senses and by being in the moment? That is what we call in Yoga as mindfulness. Heck no, why should I ‚Äì I am a woman and I pride myself on being able to multi-task. I want it all at the same time- Get the perfect dosa on the pan, scream to the apartment sec on not being overdue, sulk at the lavish outpour of Lizol into the bucket by my help, use sign language to show where the homework file is lying, while having nervous looks at the Clock! We love the circus! Many a times, not even one single activity of the listed has been accomplished to our own Gold standard benchmarking, leading to us more frustration &amp; being duped into thinking we need to perfect the art of multi-tasking!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the men are scanning newspapers and passing or flunking Mr. Modi on his 2019 prospects. Just that. Ok, may be with chai cup in hand. Voila, that‚Äôs ME TIME!! Effortless, focused and so relaxing for them all at one time. Now, this is because they simply resigned to the fact that they want to do one activity at a time and do it well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs do a reality check. Nobody is giving away shopping vouchers to the super woman who is toggling things better than the local bar-tender!! Let‚Äôs care to stop, think and reflect on the daily cues of Body pain, Stress, Irritability &amp; Frustration that‚Äôs mostly triggered by over-ambitious 20 things on a To-do List. Let‚Äôs trim it down to a 10, watch ourselves achieve at least 7 and be pleasantly surprised to find a good 30 minutes of ‚ÄúMe‚Äù Time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs accept that ALL tasks need not be multi-tasked, Revisit who &amp; what REALLY deserves our time each day, Make small but meaningful adjustments as less as 15 minutes each day and we‚Äôll soon see that the ever elusive 30 minutes of kriya time or finishing that book on Emotional Intelligence (such a dearth!) wouldn‚Äôt be as challenging as we make it out to be! Go on and get the world! But shall we try slow and easy this time <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoga is not meant for you!!</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in this world. One who fight for themselves and take charge of their life¬† and the ones who just survive. The people in first category do not fear hard work and realize that nothing worth having comes easy. However, the second category people run away from hard work, succumb to the worldly temptations and blame everyone else for whatever they face in life. So if you are reading this and realize that you belong to the second category then YOGA IS NOT MEANT FOR YOU.</p>
<p>YOGA requires eligibility to be practiced. It is not everybody‚Äôs cup of tea! If you want to be eligible for YOGA, the very first thing you should consider is SELF-ANALYSIS. Half of the people who would belong to the second category as mentioned above would not have the heart to accept it. You need to have the courage to accept what is yours. You know yourself the best. If you constantly lie to yourself and fail to admit it then you are not fit for yoga.</p>
<p>Yoga is the union of body and mind. It is the key to connect you from within and has the potential to awaken your consciousness. The people who constantly crib about being sad or how their life is the most miserable while always blaming others for their sad state of mind are very immature and certainly are not fit to practice yoga. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar¬† once said ‚ÄúYoga is not just doing some exercise, it is much more. It is to expand your awareness, sharpen your intellect and enhance your intuitive ability‚Äù.As simple it may sound, in reality expanding awareness, sharpening intellect, and enhancing your intuitive ability requires a focused and undisturbed mind. We as human beings indeed get over-whelmed by the tough situations in life but our job is not to quit! Our duty is to overcome those obstacles by self-analyzing, improving, and pushing ourselves to bring out the best in us. The truth is it requires a lot of sacrifice and self-determination, the two qualities that make you ‚ÄúYOGI‚Äù. However, if you choose to be quitters then YOGA IS NOT MEANT FOR YOU!</p>
<p>It is very easy to fall for the temptations in our mind which make us treat our bodies like trash-bin whereas our bodies are our temple. We are human beings-‚Äúthe social animals‚Äù who are blessed with a very powerful thing which makes us distinct from all the animals on this planet and that is MIND. Our minds make us who we are today. It gives us the ability to think and to decide what‚Äôs wrong or right. In one way it is the only asset that has gotten us this far out in the world. On the contrary, it is this mind that controls us and stops us from exploring our full potential. Yes, that‚Äôs true! And it is only because we let it control us. YOGA teaches us how to control our minds and unleash its power to achieve the unattainable. You are the master of your mind and its needs to follow your orders and yoga can make it happen.On the other hand if you choose to be one such person who lets the mind control you rather you tame it to explore its full potential then YOGA IS NOT MEANT FOR YOU!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After heavy dinner, you set out for a small walk.</p>
<p>After a while, aroma of fresh fried pakoda savoured your nostrils.</p>
<ol>
<li>No impulse in your mind, though you like pakodas ‚Äì you are a yogi</li>
<li>You enjoyed the pleasant smell and remembered when you had it last time ‚Äì you are viragi</li>
<li>You planned to have it next day, because you are full now. ‚Äì you are a bhogi</li>
<li>You searched for that small cart shop, bought the pakoda immediately and ate it. ‚Äì you are a ______.</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens with many of us, because the wanting creates so much discomfort in us, we immediately want to get out of it, whatever may be the consequence. Wanting is really uncomfortable. Staying with the wanting for a little longer is Tapas.</p>
<p>What is Tapas? Being comfortable in uncomfortable situation is Tapas.</p>
<p>Pakoda is a bait for somebody. What is your bait?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you feeling that life is dragging? and life is series of troubles only? then read this.</p>
<p>Time Scale for physical world/ physical body, conscious mind and subconscious mind are not same. Even modern science also accepts this. Normally we can not read the digits after decimal point in digital timer (0.1 Second resolution).¬† But, people while doing the bungy jump, they are able to read it clearly as if it is seconds scale, not one tenth of a second. i.e., time scale expanded about ten times. During accidents many people experience that the movements are just like slow motion picture. It is because of the takeover of subconscious mind.</p>
<p>When conscious mind is awake / alert, subconscious mind will be in rest. When conscious mind is in rest (sleep or unconscious), subconscious mind takes the charge. During the transition, one can experience time expansion, as above.</p>
<p>A quite interesting example was given by Master E.K. (founder of World Teacher Trust), in this regard.</p>
<p>A person, very lightly pricked his deep sleeping friend with a safety pin, to wake him up. Within the transition of deep sleep to wakefulness, (probably about half a second time), he had a dream. In that, he is chased by a tiger in a forest, running very fast, gasping, terrified and finally fell on a thorny bush. Feeling the pricks of hundreds of thorns, he shouted aloud Aa&#8230;. and woke up.</p>
<p>In our scriptures, celestial sage Narada had similar experience. Within the time of one holy dip, he had the experience of a whole life as a woman who married a king, be got many children and suffered the loss of them in a flood; in the dream</p>
<p>Many of us feel, time passing quickly in happy moments and very dragging in difficult moments. For wakeful mind also time scale differs depending on the situation and how we take it. There is no known limit for this time expansion factor for general public. [For lovers 1 yuga (1000s of years) = 1 Kshana ( a second) in union, and 1 kshana = 1 yuga in separation].</p>
<p>I now understood that players when they are in total attention, can see the movement of ball / opponent very clearly, just like we see it on slow motion replay. That means, with intense focus, time slows down (sometimes freezes).</p>
<p>In life, we are focusing more on negative experiences, making the life dragging. Those who live in present moment, don‚Äôt experience much difference in time factor for happy and sad moments. Shifting the focus onto positive moments will expand joyful time. But, how to shift the focus?¬† Focus on negative is effortless and focus on positive seems to be not in our control, because we habituated our mind like that. Now we have to reverse it step by step.</p>
<p>Start with food. Give your 100 % while eating food or drinking water. Chew well, feel the taste, feel the pleasantness in the stomach, savour every bit of it, every gulp of it. If you can start this, you will know what to do next, to make your life more joyful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SLEEP</strong></p>
<p>Sleep is one of the four main natural tendencies of the body ‚Äì Ahara, Nidra, Bhaya, Maidhuna</p>
<p>Disturbed sleep not only weakens the body, it also disturbs the mind a lot and meditation becomes dull &amp; sleepy. If you are serious about health (physical &amp; mental) and meditation, you cannot ignore inculcating healthy sleep habits. Hardest one may be keeping the mobile away from bed when you go to sleep, but it is a must.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other easy ones are:</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid drinking Tea / Coffee / Soft drinks</li>
<li>Eat soft &amp; light dinner before 7:30 PM, so that, by the time you go to sleep, food is digested, and stomach and digestion glands are at rest.</li>
<li>Avoid drinking lot of water in the night, not to get disturbed in the middle of the sleep with urination urgency. One glass of lukewarm water before sleep is good enough.</li>
<li>To calm the mind, read a few pages of some good books or spend some time with your loved ones ‚Äì parents, siblings, grand parents. . . . , (with spouse ‚Äì take care ‚Äì it should be sharing kind of talk, not arguing ‚Äì which is most common)</li>
</ol>
<p>After lying down on the bed, till you fall asleep, try the following one by one.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Take 11 deep ujjai breaths, counting down from 11 to 1</li>
<li>Feel the presence of your beloved Master / God very close to you. Or imagine yourself as a small baby, sleeping in the lap of God / Master, while God / Master is looking over you with his infinite love.</li>
<li>Practice forgiveness, to remove victim consciousness or culprit consciousness from your mind, which robs your sleep. Whole heartedly forgive those who made you suffer. Ask the God / you Master (Guru) / the people whom you made suffer ‚Äì by mistake, to forgive you.</li>
<li>Rhythmic chanting of any mantra (like OM, AMEN, AMEEN, Om Namah Shivaya), in the mind, not aloud, not even moving the lips.</li>
<li>Mentally listen to the sound <strong><em>SO</em></strong> while inhalation is happening and <strong><em>HUM</em></strong> while exhalation is happening, as long as you feel like.</li>
<li>Affirm yourself, that you going to have a deeply relaxing sleep and you will be fresh when you wake-up.</li>
<li>Practice yoga nidra. Scan the body mentally, from top of the head to toes or¬†¬† toes to top of the head and back to toes. While moving the attention to a part, take a deep breath and move on to next part.</li>
</ol>
<p>After trying all the above, you are still awake means, you don‚Äôt need to sleep. Get up, read books or do some work.</p>
