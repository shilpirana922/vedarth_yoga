				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“What’s “Me” time?? Isn’t all the time you have just yours as it is for everyone on earth?” quipped Mom, with a perplexed look, when I complained of the lack of it, after I had my baby girl. Her response didn’t come without any wisdom in it and it took me a few years to get the depth. As women we always pride ourselves in being excellent multi-taskers- Oh yeah, I see the nod <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> yet have you ever heard our opposite gender ever complain about not having any “Me” time?? Smile and admit it – they rarely do! Of course now are minds are racing against all odds to prove why they don’t complain…I will let you do that, but not before you finish this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there may be a plethora of reasons you have listed on the Why, the fact remains it is a rare feeling for men. I am least feminist in general &amp; even less in women’s circles as my personal take is that it’s an image we want to fall in love with most of the times and satisfy the “sense of belonging” to the elite group of independent, strong willed, fear nothing women we all aspire to be. So I will be just that and point out that we have a thing or two we could borrow from our dear men when it comes to “Me” Time.</p>
<p>Firstly, “Me” time need not Always be this secluded, cozy spot you have found yourself to read your favorite author sipping some divine coffee!! Wake up and smell the coffee, now really!! It can be very much part of a regular day in which you beat your alarm in being up, zoom past the morning dailies including packing husband/child/dabbas and helps at home, rush to office, finish the daily dose of banter with colleagues and land in a thud at the office chair only to find yourself drowning in a sea storm of mails and deadlines! Phew, it’s just 3-4 hours into the day and you would easily trade an arm to get a back and foot massage coz you have achieved so much already! Hah, really? Now rewind and slow down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of each activity accomplished since you woke up and ask yourself &#8211; Was there a single minute where you did any activity in full awareness, aligned with all your senses and by being in the moment? That is what we call in Yoga as mindfulness. Heck no, why should I – I am a woman and I pride myself on being able to multi-task. I want it all at the same time- Get the perfect dosa on the pan, scream to the apartment sec on not being overdue, sulk at the lavish outpour of Lizol into the bucket by my help, use sign language to show where the homework file is lying, while having nervous looks at the Clock! We love the circus! Many a times, not even one single activity of the listed has been accomplished to our own Gold standard benchmarking, leading to us more frustration &amp; being duped into thinking we need to perfect the art of multi-tasking!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the men are scanning newspapers and passing or flunking Mr. Modi on his 2019 prospects. Just that. Ok, may be with chai cup in hand. Voila, that’s ME TIME!! Effortless, focused and so relaxing for them all at one time. Now, this is because they simply resigned to the fact that they want to do one activity at a time and do it well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s do a reality check. Nobody is giving away shopping vouchers to the super woman who is toggling things better than the local bar-tender!! Let’s care to stop, think and reflect on the daily cues of Body pain, Stress, Irritability &amp; Frustration that’s mostly triggered by over-ambitious 20 things on a To-do List. Let’s trim it down to a 10, watch ourselves achieve at least 7 and be pleasantly surprised to find a good 30 minutes of “Me” Time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s accept that ALL tasks need not be multi-tasked, Revisit who &amp; what REALLY deserves our time each day, Make small but meaningful adjustments as less as 15 minutes each day and we’ll soon see that the ever elusive 30 minutes of kriya time or finishing that book on Emotional Intelligence (such a dearth!) wouldn’t be as challenging as we make it out to be! Go on and get the world! But shall we try slow and easy this time <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three or more times a day, our bodies present to us the opportunity to become healthier, happier and a step closer to realizing the true potential of a yogic being, in this limited, rented time on earth. Yet, the fuss around food today revolves around a narrow path of calories, proteins, carbs, fats, diets- words, that we, as a nation were alien to once upon a peaceful time. Worse still, it’s just another chore. With the advent of technology and an ever-online population, we gained newer knowledge of the wide variety of flora and fauna that could be on our plates, closing the door on the age-old food wisdom, we had passed on for generations without so much of a murmur.</p>
<p>And today, when the western world is instagramming Tuh-muh-ric lattes, 101 uses for Coconut oil, Millet cupcakes, moringa body butters in impeccable backgrounds and filters, our own daadi’s, bammas and ammamas, grin bright from above, with their all-knowing toothless smiles, at the fate of us, progidal children! Ghar aa ja paradesi, with pride, now that we have the nods through hashtags and viral videos, before it’s lost forever?</p>
<p>Get stronger and healthier the easy way! For all of you who have already begun your all-round fitness through Yoga, reviving food habits and culture that was native to our land, is but a natural choice.</p>
<p>We all know food is an essential change area to make in our journey to fitness, yet we are a flustered lot because we don’t know what (all) to change or even where to begin. Fret not, a good place to start would be some basic steps to build into your yogic lifestyle. 5 to be precise!</p>
<p>1. Eat local.<br />
2. Eat seasonal.<br />
3. Eat on time.<br />
4. Eat unprocessed.<br />
5. Eat only when hungry.</p>
<p>Simple, right? Not quite, I guess because &#8211; Ok Google (Alexa, whatever..) tell me what’s local, is NOT going to work since Google’s answers have not been through the lie detector! Let’s do something more effective. For each point above, you can try to incorporate 1 habit that you can adopt and sustain. 1. Eat local: This means you will buy at least 1 item from your local sabziwala on foot, on cycles, push carts, or sitting on roads with baskets of just 1 or few varieties of fruit or vegetables. Weekly santhas (markets) on roads, raithu bazaars close to you, are also good options.</p>
<p>2. Eat seasonal: If you really manage to find a local grocery vendor, in all probability the produce is<br />
seasonal too (because they do not have the means to get avocadoes for you!). Read up on<br />
what’s seasonal or dial up an organic food vendor to find out seasonal veggies and fruits and<br />
add them to your meals, one at a time.</p>
<p>3. Eat on time: As we all have diverse jobs and shifts, this is a very critical factor to health that is<br />
ignored by all and sundry. On time simply means, eating ‘On time’ and ‘In pace’ with our<br />
biological clock and nature.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a. Breakfast- Ideal time: 7:00 am to 9 am. Maximum before 9:30 am<br />
b. Lunch- Ideal time: 12 noon to 1:30 pm. Maximum before 2:00 pm<br />
c. Evening- Ideal time: 4 pm to 5 pm. Maximum before 6:00 pm<br />
d. Dinner- Ideal time: 7 pm to 8:30 pm. Maximum before 9:00 pm</p>
<p>Note: If your work, does not permit the above, then there are a few tips to ensure you still stay in rhythm with your biological clock! Stay tuned to know more.</p>
<p>4. Eat unprocessed: This is a highly challenging one and can work with just a bit planning. Most unprocessed items we eat, fall into the category of snacks or beverages. The trick lies in replacing your biscuit, chips, maida based samosa with fresh fruits, peanut/till chikki, teplas, puffed rice snacks, home-made moong, ragi ladoos, barley, sabudaana kheer etc.</p>
<p>5. Eat ONLY when hungry: Silly? It’s a fact that many of us today, simply do not know whether we are hungry or thirsty and solve it by EATING anyway! If you don’t believe me on this one, try this. Drink water instead of eating, the next time you feel you are hungry. If you don’t feel hungry again in a few minutes, then you are wiser, knowing how the mind has tricked you. Done with complete sincerity, with just these 5 changes, you are bound to notice benefits you long craved for- increased energy levels, better temperament, lesser acidity and digestive issues amongst<br />
many others. As with any journey, you only know the thorns in the path, once you take it! So go on take it, celebrate your little milestones, jot down your challenges, until we connect back to doing a fun 2 part exercise that will help you nail this lifestyle !</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why eat chickpeas?</p>
<p>Well, I would say one of my most favorite among breakfast meals would be chickpeas.</p>
<p>Chickpeas can be a wholesome breakfast meal loaded with nutrition and crunch.  They boost up and keep you energized throughout the day. So, if I am giving so much of attention to this bean then there is something amazing you need to know about this wonder bean which will only give you the “wow” feels. It is known that chickpeas are only naturally occurring bean and all other beans are patented which would have never been occurred in nature. Interesting isn&#8217;t it? Whether you add them to a salad, curry, soups, sandwiches or prefer them grind up as hummus they taste great in every way and can be a healthy addition to your daily diet. They are extremely high in protein and are suitable for all the diets. So, let us make some room for chickpeas in our body and get to know some more amazing facts and benefits below</p>
<p>Did you know?</p>
<ul>
<li>This original bean helps in proper functioning of the body, improves concentration power and strengthens the immune system.</li>
<li>Iron in the chickpeas improves hemoglobin levels and blood flow to the heart.</li>
<li>Fiber is very essential for our body and especially helps in preventing diabetes and many other diseases. It plays a huge role in our overall health, which is why eating high fiber foods has a wide range of benefits. Now you must be wondering why am I talking about fiber in detail because chickpeas are particularly high in fiber and people with type 1 diabetes who consume high fiber diets will have lower blood glucose levels.</li>
<li>They are very low in fat and one of the healthiest I say.</li>
<li>They control blood pressure levels.</li>
<li>They are the best in providing the body with minerals and vitamins.</li>
<li>Most importantly it provides the body with plant-based proteins too. Vegetarians rejoice!!</li>
<li>So, these are some of the most essential points to be known for a healthy living.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now coming to the nutrition facts of chickpeas. The picture below explains it very clearly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The numerous components of yoga make sure that every single person regardless of their health condition can practice Yoga. Despite this fact, everyone cannot practice it!! Practicing yoga does not only imply the act of doing asanas. Yoga enlightens your spirit and mind. It works for the wholesomeness of the body. So, read along to find out the reasons why everyone can’t practice yoga!</p>
<p>I may not be wrong if I say we are all different from each other but still, we are the same. All of us are made of flesh and blood. We all share the same organs that fill the cavity of our bodies and have a heart whose function is to pump blood to all these organs to keep us alive. Most importantly, what guides all these processes is our brain. We share the same planet, breathe in oxygen, follow a routine in life just so that we can give the best to our families and children. So when the essential components of life are all the same for us what makes us different from each there? The answer lies in the Yama and Niyamawhich are essential components of yoga. I am going to share five Yama (social ethics) and five niyama (personal ethics) that make us different from each other and have a crucial role in answering the question “Why everyone can’t practice Yoga?”</p>
<p>The five Yamas which teach you social ethics are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ahimsa: Today the world is misguided to the extent that people resort to violence to feel superior. With ahimsa I imply getting rid of having the urge to hurt someone. It need not be only physical but can be emotionally too. Just remember that if we don’t hurt ourselves, then don’t hurt anyone!!</li>
<li>Satyam: The act of speaking the truth. We are always tempted towards lying because we think that it makes things easy but it kills your moral value. Honesty, loyalty, and trust make the basis of humanity. So stick to it!</li>
<li>Asteya: The cruel fact is everyone cannot get everything. So accept the fact and don’t make your life miserable over what you don’t have.</li>
<li>Bramhacharya: Do not confine yourself to objects. Stop being materialistic. Look at the bigger picture, look within. Detach yourself from the worldly temptations and the world will fall at your feet. We need to understand that all these emotions, materialistic temptations are temporary. They don’t aim at giving you eternal happiness. So awaken yourself and look beyond to find the beauty of this life.</li>
<li>Aparigraha: You know your worth so don’t fall for somebody’s appreciation or criticism for you.</li>
</ol>
<p>The five Niyama that impart personal ethics are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saucha (Cleanliness):One needs to clean the body not only externally but also internally which implies purifying your mind and heart of all the negative thoughts.</li>
<li>Santosha (Happiness): Happiness lies within you. We are lost in this vast universe and hence we look for it outside in somebody or in something. Stop!! Look within you. Stop complicating things for yourself!</li>
<li>Tapas: the act of feeling comfortable in uncomfortable situations. This implies that smile which you wear on your face when you are going through a hard time. That is just what is required to overcome hardships of life.</li>
<li>Swadhyaya (Self-analysis): Self-analysis is important for improvement in your character and your mental progress. We grow physically with our age but it is important to attain wisdom as we climb the ladder of life.</li>
<li>IshwaraParidhana: The act of surrendering to God. In tough situations remember that God, the supreme intelligence, is there to guide you through. You just need to give away yourself to Him without a slightest inch of doubt.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are only a handful of people in this world who currently follow these five rules of Yama and Niyama. You could be one of them even if you learn to follow these rules to the best of your ability. There would definitely be some people who will not relate to these rules at all and find them not required to lead a peaceful life. They continue to live in a delusional world where temptations are everything. It is this difference among our perspectives and our personalities that decides who can practice yoga and who cannot hence giving us the reason why everyone cannot practice Yoga !!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoga is not meant for you!!</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in this world. One who fight for themselves and take charge of their life  and the ones who just survive. The people in first category do not fear hard work and realize that nothing worth having comes easy. However, the second category people run away from hard work, succumb to the worldly temptations and blame everyone else for whatever they face in life. So if you are reading this and realize that you belong to the second category then YOGA IS NOT MEANT FOR YOU.</p>
<p>YOGA requires eligibility to be practiced. It is not everybody’s cup of tea! If you want to be eligible for YOGA, the very first thing you should consider is SELF-ANALYSIS. Half of the people who would belong to the second category as mentioned above would not have the heart to accept it. You need to have the courage to accept what is yours. You know yourself the best. If you constantly lie to yourself and fail to admit it then you are not fit for yoga.</p>
<p>Yoga is the union of body and mind. It is the key to connect you from within and has the potential to awaken your consciousness. The people who constantly crib about being sad or how their life is the most miserable while always blaming others for their sad state of mind are very immature and certainly are not fit to practice yoga. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar  once said “Yoga is not just doing some exercise, it is much more. It is to expand your awareness, sharpen your intellect and enhance your intuitive ability”.As simple it may sound, in reality expanding awareness, sharpening intellect, and enhancing your intuitive ability requires a focused and undisturbed mind. We as human beings indeed get over-whelmed by the tough situations in life but our job is not to quit! Our duty is to overcome those obstacles by self-analyzing, improving, and pushing ourselves to bring out the best in us. The truth is it requires a lot of sacrifice and self-determination, the two qualities that make you “YOGI”. However, if you choose to be quitters then YOGA IS NOT MEANT FOR YOU!</p>
<p>It is very easy to fall for the temptations in our mind which make us treat our bodies like trash-bin whereas our bodies are our temple. We are human beings-“the social animals” who are blessed with a very powerful thing which makes us distinct from all the animals on this planet and that is MIND. Our minds make us who we are today. It gives us the ability to think and to decide what’s wrong or right. In one way it is the only asset that has gotten us this far out in the world. On the contrary, it is this mind that controls us and stops us from exploring our full potential. Yes, that’s true! And it is only because we let it control us. YOGA teaches us how to control our minds and unleash its power to achieve the unattainable. You are the master of your mind and its needs to follow your orders and yoga can make it happen.On the other hand if you choose to be one such person who lets the mind control you rather you tame it to explore its full potential then YOGA IS NOT MEANT FOR YOU!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Pregnancy Yoga for Third Trimester</strong></h2>
<p>Author: Pallavi Marshal, Certified Yoga Trainer, Bodhi Yoga Academy</p>
<p><a href="https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-619 alignleft" src="https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-300x300.jpg 300w, https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-150x150.jpg 150w, https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Third Trimester</strong></p>
<p>In this trimester with the growing baby inside, the body’s centre of gravity changes, so care should be taken, particularly for standing and balancing asanas, despite wall support.</p>
<p>Symptoms like heart burn, frequent urination, back pain and swelling in the limbs cause discomfort which continued practice of yoga can help alleviate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Relieving pressure from the back is essential so in place of Shavasana, lying on the side with bolster or supported Supta Badhkonasana are preferred for Yoga Nidra and rest.</li>
<li>Pelvic tilts and gentle spinal stretches should be performed for relaxing the back.</li>
<li>Vipritkarni with legs up on the wall helps relieving swollen legs and feet.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Sukha Prasava Mantra can be chanted throughout the pregnancy and during delivery:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">Mathru boodeshwara devo </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">Bakthanaam ishta thayaka </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">Sukanthi kunthala naavaha </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">Sukha Prasava Mrichchathuhuhu</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Meaning</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">Salutations to you, Oh goddess; </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">You are the mother of all gods; </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">You are the great goddess, who is always kind to your devotees, </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">I&#8217;m invoking you to please protect this lady, </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">Who is your devotee and who is constantly praying to you. </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">By your grace, please bless her with a beautiful baby and a safe delivery.</span></p>
<p><strong><u>Benefits </u></strong></p>
<p>The benefits of Yoga surpass the physical level and extend to the mental and spiritual level as well. Relaxed body and positive state of mind results in an overall healthy pregnancy where the mother is in tune with the changes in her body :</p>
<ul>
<li>Yogasanas provide the needed flexibility and strength to the right set of muscles required for child birth.</li>
<li>Hip openers and gentle supported back bends can help ease tension and prepare the body for delivery</li>
<li>Relaxation techniques like Yoga Nidra and Meditation are beneficial in keeping depression and anxiety away</li>
<li>Pranayama increases the <em>Prana</em> and is great for energizing the entire body</li>
<li>Breathing techniques practised during pregnancy are also helpful when in labour</li>
<li>Regular Yoga practice can result in mindful eating and healthy weight gain</li>
<li>Improvement in the quality of sleep</li>
<li>Prenatal yoga classes are a perfect time to connect with the baby and feel its movements</li>
<li>A Stress-free healthy pregnancy reduces the chances of complications during birth and thereafter</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Contraindications and Precautions </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doctor’s approval is essential before starting the practice as women with certain medical conditions and those with high risk pregnancies need to exercise caution</li>
<li>Expecting mothers should practice under the guidance of a certified yoga professional</li>
<li>Hot Yoga, Power Yoga and intense forms like Vinyasa are not recommended during pregnancy</li>
<li>Inversions, deep twists and backbends, Lying on the belly or flat on the back (second trimester onwards) are contraindicated</li>
<li>Asanas which put too much pressure on the abdomen (Boat Pose, Chaturangasana etc)</li>
<li>Kumbhaka (holding of breath) and Pranayamas which involve rapid breathing like Kapalbhati to be strictly avoided</li>
<li>Yoga should be practised in a well ventilated room</li>
