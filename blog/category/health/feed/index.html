				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three or more times a day, our bodies present to us the opportunity to become healthier, happier and a step closer to realizing the true potential of a yogic being, in this limited, rented time on earth. Yet, the fuss around food today revolves around a narrow path of calories, proteins, carbs, fats, diets- words, that we, as a nation were alien to once upon a peaceful time. Worse still, it’s just another chore. With the advent of technology and an ever-online population, we gained newer knowledge of the wide variety of flora and fauna that could be on our plates, closing the door on the age-old food wisdom, we had passed on for generations without so much of a murmur.</p>
<p>And today, when the western world is instagramming Tuh-muh-ric lattes, 101 uses for Coconut oil, Millet cupcakes, moringa body butters in impeccable backgrounds and filters, our own daadi’s, bammas and ammamas, grin bright from above, with their all-knowing toothless smiles, at the fate of us, progidal children! Ghar aa ja paradesi, with pride, now that we have the nods through hashtags and viral videos, before it’s lost forever?</p>
<p>Get stronger and healthier the easy way! For all of you who have already begun your all-round fitness through Yoga, reviving food habits and culture that was native to our land, is but a natural choice.</p>
<p>We all know food is an essential change area to make in our journey to fitness, yet we are a flustered lot because we don’t know what (all) to change or even where to begin. Fret not, a good place to start would be some basic steps to build into your yogic lifestyle. 5 to be precise!</p>
<p>1. Eat local.<br />
2. Eat seasonal.<br />
3. Eat on time.<br />
4. Eat unprocessed.<br />
5. Eat only when hungry.</p>
<p>Simple, right? Not quite, I guess because &#8211; Ok Google (Alexa, whatever..) tell me what’s local, is NOT going to work since Google’s answers have not been through the lie detector! Let’s do something more effective. For each point above, you can try to incorporate 1 habit that you can adopt and sustain. 1. Eat local: This means you will buy at least 1 item from your local sabziwala on foot, on cycles, push carts, or sitting on roads with baskets of just 1 or few varieties of fruit or vegetables. Weekly santhas (markets) on roads, raithu bazaars close to you, are also good options.</p>
<p>2. Eat seasonal: If you really manage to find a local grocery vendor, in all probability the produce is<br />
seasonal too (because they do not have the means to get avocadoes for you!). Read up on<br />
what’s seasonal or dial up an organic food vendor to find out seasonal veggies and fruits and<br />
add them to your meals, one at a time.</p>
<p>3. Eat on time: As we all have diverse jobs and shifts, this is a very critical factor to health that is<br />
ignored by all and sundry. On time simply means, eating ‘On time’ and ‘In pace’ with our<br />
biological clock and nature.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a. Breakfast- Ideal time: 7:00 am to 9 am. Maximum before 9:30 am<br />
b. Lunch- Ideal time: 12 noon to 1:30 pm. Maximum before 2:00 pm<br />
c. Evening- Ideal time: 4 pm to 5 pm. Maximum before 6:00 pm<br />
d. Dinner- Ideal time: 7 pm to 8:30 pm. Maximum before 9:00 pm</p>
<p>Note: If your work, does not permit the above, then there are a few tips to ensure you still stay in rhythm with your biological clock! Stay tuned to know more.</p>
<p>4. Eat unprocessed: This is a highly challenging one and can work with just a bit planning. Most unprocessed items we eat, fall into the category of snacks or beverages. The trick lies in replacing your biscuit, chips, maida based samosa with fresh fruits, peanut/till chikki, teplas, puffed rice snacks, home-made moong, ragi ladoos, barley, sabudaana kheer etc.</p>
<p>5. Eat ONLY when hungry: Silly? It’s a fact that many of us today, simply do not know whether we are hungry or thirsty and solve it by EATING anyway! If you don’t believe me on this one, try this. Drink water instead of eating, the next time you feel you are hungry. If you don’t feel hungry again in a few minutes, then you are wiser, knowing how the mind has tricked you. Done with complete sincerity, with just these 5 changes, you are bound to notice benefits you long craved for- increased energy levels, better temperament, lesser acidity and digestive issues amongst<br />
many others. As with any journey, you only know the thorns in the path, once you take it! So go on take it, celebrate your little milestones, jot down your challenges, until we connect back to doing a fun 2 part exercise that will help you nail this lifestyle !</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why eat chickpeas?</p>
<p>Well, I would say one of my most favorite among breakfast meals would be chickpeas.</p>
<p>Chickpeas can be a wholesome breakfast meal loaded with nutrition and crunch.  They boost up and keep you energized throughout the day. So, if I am giving so much of attention to this bean then there is something amazing you need to know about this wonder bean which will only give you the “wow” feels. It is known that chickpeas are only naturally occurring bean and all other beans are patented which would have never been occurred in nature. Interesting isn&#8217;t it? Whether you add them to a salad, curry, soups, sandwiches or prefer them grind up as hummus they taste great in every way and can be a healthy addition to your daily diet. They are extremely high in protein and are suitable for all the diets. So, let us make some room for chickpeas in our body and get to know some more amazing facts and benefits below</p>
<p>Did you know?</p>
<ul>
<li>This original bean helps in proper functioning of the body, improves concentration power and strengthens the immune system.</li>
<li>Iron in the chickpeas improves hemoglobin levels and blood flow to the heart.</li>
<li>Fiber is very essential for our body and especially helps in preventing diabetes and many other diseases. It plays a huge role in our overall health, which is why eating high fiber foods has a wide range of benefits. Now you must be wondering why am I talking about fiber in detail because chickpeas are particularly high in fiber and people with type 1 diabetes who consume high fiber diets will have lower blood glucose levels.</li>
<li>They are very low in fat and one of the healthiest I say.</li>
<li>They control blood pressure levels.</li>
<li>They are the best in providing the body with minerals and vitamins.</li>
<li>Most importantly it provides the body with plant-based proteins too. Vegetarians rejoice!!</li>
<li>So, these are some of the most essential points to be known for a healthy living.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Author : Dr. Nidhi Khurana, Bodhi Certified Yoga Trainer, USA</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what is it in our body that <strong>regulates</strong> our <strong>heart beat</strong> or <strong>rate</strong> of <strong>metabolism</strong>? We all know that some of us burn calories faster (higher metabolic rate) than the others. But which organ/gland in our body controls this aspect.</p>
<p>It is the thyroid gland!</p>
<p>The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland which is located in the neck. Its role is to produce the hormones which regulate the body metabolism. We know that our body metabolism is directly related to the body temperature and body weight.</p>
<p>The thyroid gland also controls the functioning of vital organs such as the lungs, and heart, blood pressure, mood, bowel movements and menstrual cycles. You can consider it as a crucial regulator of all the functions in our body. Given its significance in regulating the functions of our body, unfortunately, thyroid gland disorders are highly prevalent in the population.</p>
<p>In India, 1 in 10 adults suffers from the thyroid disorder. Studies also show that women are at higher risk of having thyroid diseases than men which is further enhanced right after pregnancy and menopause. The imbalance in thyroid can also contribute to depression.</p>
<p>There can be two kinds of thyroid disorders based on the amount of hormones being produced by this gland:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hypothyroidism: When the thyroid gland produces less than the required amount of hormones. It is found to be three times more common in women.</li>
<li>Hyperthyroidism: When the thyroid gland produces more than the required amount of hormones.</li>
</ol>
<p>These disorders pose different kinds of challenges in every day body functions and require different treatment and changes in food habits to cure them.</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
<p>Hypothyroidism:</p>
<p>The low level of hormones from the thyroid gland slow things down in our body. Hence, we experience: Weight gain, Puffy eyes, Feeling sad or depressed, Frequent and heavy menstrual flow, Constipation, Tiredness, Muscle cramps, Intolerance to cold, Dry skin and hair, and hoarse voice.</p>
<p>Hyperthyroidism:</p>
<p>This is when all the functions occur at a rate faster than the normal and thus the symptoms include: Increased sweating, Sleep disturbances, Bulging eyes, Weight Loss, Rapid and irregular heart rate, Feeling irritable, Frequent bowel movements, Intolerance to heat, Infrequent and scant menstrual periods.</p>
<p><strong>Foods to eat:</strong></p>
<p>During hypothyroidism: Nuts, Fruits, and vegetables rich in anti-oxidants and vitamin B like blueberries, cherries, bell peppers, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, Whole grains, Dairy products, Seaweed which is an excellent source of iodine, calcium, and vitamin A, B, C, E, and K.</p>
<p>During hyperthyroidism: Foods that are rich in vitamin D, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids like nuts, flaxseed, and olive oil, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage.</p>
<p><strong>Foods to avoid:</strong></p>
<p>During Hypothyroidism: Soy products, Gluten (bread), processed foods, cruciferous vegetables, high-fat foods, high-carb foods, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine.</p>
<p>During hyperthyroidism: foods that are high in iodine content like seaweed, fried foods, sugary foods, salt.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ఆమ్లం పెరగడం సాధారణ మైనదే అయినా, చాలా ఎక్కువ ఇబ్బందిని కలిగిస్తుంది. అలాగే వదిలేస్తే తీవ్ర అనారోగ్యాన్నీ కలిగిస్తుంది. కొద్దిపాటి జాగ్రత్తలు / చిట్కాలు పాటిస్తే, చాలా ఇబ్బందులు దూరమవుతాయి, ఆసుపత్రుల చుట్టూ తిరగడమూ తప్పుతుంది.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 . ఏమి తిన్నా, బాగా నమిలి నమిలి మింగాలి. లాలాజలం క్షార గుణం కలిగి ఉంటుంది. నమలడం వల్ల, ప్రతి ఆహార కణమూ లాలాజలంతో కలిసి, ఆహారం క్షార గుణాన్ని పొందుతుంది. దానివల్ల, రక్తంలో ఆమ్లం తగ్గి, క్షార గుణం కాపాడ బడుతుంది.</p>
<p>2 . తక్కువ పట్టు బియ్యం వాడాలి. పాలిష్ చేసిన తెల్ల బియ్యపు అన్నం ఆమ్లాన్ని పెంచుతుంది. ఒంటి పట్టు బియ్యపు అన్నం  క్షార గుణాన్ని కలిగిస్తుంది.</p>
<p>3 . మైదా పదార్ధాలని పూర్తిగా మానెయ్యాలి. మైదా చాలా ఎక్కువ ఆమ్ల గుణం కలిగి ఉంటుంది. బయట తింటున్నప్పుడు, మైదాతో చేసిన వాటిని మాని, (బిస్కట్లు కూడా ), గోధుమ పిండితో చేసిన వాటికి ప్రాధాన్యం ఇవ్వండి. దక్షిణ భారతీయులకి గోధుమ కూడా ఆమ్లాన్ని కలిగిస్తుంది. గోధుమ బదులుగా జొన్నలు, సజ్జలు మొదలైన చిరు ధాన్యాల్ని వాడుకోవాలి.</p>
<p>4 . పంచదార చాలా ఎసిడిటీని పెంచుతుంది. దాని బదులు బెల్లము, పటిక బెల్లము కొంత మెరుగైనవి. బెల్లముతో చేసిన పదార్ధాలను తిన్న అరగంట తర్వాత మంచినీళ్లు తాగితే, బెల్లం ఆమ్లాన్ని పెంచకుండా, ఉపయోగపడే ఎంజైమ్ గా మారుతుంది. ఎక్కువగా తింటే, బెల్లము, పటిక బెల్లము కూడా మంచివి కావు.</p>
<p>5 . పుల్లటి పండ్లు తినవద్దు. పండిన బత్తాయి, కమలా పండ్లు పర్వాలేదు కానీ, నారింజ పండ్లు చాలా తక్కువగా తినాలి. నారింజ రసానికి అంతే నీరు కలిపి, కొంచెం ఉప్పు వేసుకుని తాగితే, వారానికి ఒకసారి పర్వాలేదు. పండిన అనాస చిన్న ముక్క పర్వాలేదు.</p>
<p>6 . జీర్ణ ప్రక్రియ అవసరమైన దేదైనా, ఘనం గాని, ద్రవం గాని, తేలికగా గాని, అధికంగా గాని, తీసుకుంటున్నప్పుడు, నీరు తాగవద్దు. ఒకటి లేదా రెండు గంటల వ్యవధి తర్వాత తాగవచ్చు. ఆహారంతో పాటు నీరు తాగితే జీర్ణ రసాలు పలుచనై, మరింత ఎక్కువ జీర్ణ రసాల అవసరం ఏర్పడుతుంది. మరీ అవసరమైతే, భోజనం తర్వాత ఒక కప్పు వేడి నీరు తాగవచ్చు.</p>
<p>7 . ఎక్కువగా తింటే గ్యాస్ట్రిక్ ఎసిడిటీ వస్తుంది. విందు భోజనం తర్వాత, ప్రతీ అరగంటకి అర కప్పు వేడి నీరు తాగితే, పొట్ట శాంతిస్తుంది.</p>
<p>8 . వేళకు తినకుంటే, ముఖ్యంగా పిత్త శరీరం వాళ్ళకి; ఆమ్లం పెరిగి పొట్టలో పుండ్లు ఏర్పడతాయి. వేళకు తినాల్సిందే. ఎప్పుడైనా కానిపరిస్థితుల్లో భోజనం వేళకి, భోజనం వీలు కానప్పుడు, కొబ్బరి నీరు గాని, మజ్జిగ గాని తాగి, జీర్ణ రసాల్ని కొంతవరకు ఉపశమింప జేయాలి.</p>
<p>9 . సూక్ష్మ క్రిముల వల్ల పొట్టలో ఇబ్బంది ఏర్పడితే, గోరు వెచ్చని నీటిలో తేనె కలిపి తాగడం మంచిది.</p>
<p>10 . కరక్కాయ పేడులు దగ్గర పెట్టుకుని, పొట్ట మండినప్పుడల్లా, ఒక ముక్క బుగ్గన పెట్టుకుని, ఆరసాన్ని మింగుతుంటే వెంటనే ఉపశమనాన్ని ఇస్తుంది.</p>
<p>11 . ప్రతీరోజూ 10 &#8211; 15 నిమిషాలు, శంఖ ముద్ర, ప్రాణ ముద్ర సాధన చెయ్యాలి.</p>
<p>12 . సోడాగాస్ కలిగిఉన్న శీతల పానీయాలన్నీ తీవ్రమైన ఎసిడిటీని కలిగించేవే. వాటి బదులు ; పంచదార, పాలు కలపని పండ్ల రసాల్ని సేవించండి.</p>
<p>13 . చాలా కాలంగా ఉన్న, తీవ్రమైన కోపం, పగ, ద్వేషం, అసూయ లాంటి నకారాత్మకమైన భావాలన్నీ మనల్ని తీవ్ర అనారోగ్యాల పాలు చేస్తాయి. ప్రేగుల్లో పుండ్లు ఆ వ్యాధుల్లో ఒకటి. మీ వివేకంతో, ఏది నిత్యం, ఏది అనిత్యం &#8211; నిదానించండి. యోగ సాధన, ధ్యానములతో శాంతించండి.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mistakes are simple. The consequences are very dangerous. Irony is, we take it as modern way of living.</p>
<ol>
<li>Salads with meal: eating cooked and raw vegetables together is a poisonous combination. It produces gas in stomach and many toxins, due to fermentation of raw vegetables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having raw vegetables or fruits – one hour before or one hour after the meal is alright.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Non-veg and curd is very unhealthy combination. For south Indians, especially Andhra and Telangana people, without curd, the meal is not complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to rise in nonveg eating, and curd as usual, diabetics are highest in these two states. 4 out of 10 are taking medicines. 3 are yet to know they are having diabetes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Spicy food and curd is also unhealthy combination, as above.</li>
<li>Eating without sufficient gap: our traditional habit is three square meals a day. But todays practice / dieticians advise is eight small meals a day; eating at every two hours. But how much small?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are eating when you are not hungry, it produces ama (free radicals, oxidents and other toxins), which will result in auto immune disorder, jamming the joints with toxins etc.</p>
<p>Consider the following for less harm.</p>
<p>a. Firstful of soaked nuts / sprouts / soaked dry fruits, or honey and lime juice with luke warm water, before 6:30 AM</p>
<p>b. Moderate breakfast at 8:30 AM</p>
<p>c. Fruits / Salads / cocoanut water at 12:00 Noon</p>
<p>d. Good Lunch at 1:30 PM</p>
<p>e. Herbal tea with sprouted-ragi biscuits or ragi malt if you are hungry (otherwise only herbal tea) at 5:30 PM</p>
<p>f. Light dinner at 7:30 PM</p>
<p>g. Milk at 10:00 PM</p>
<p>5. Sticky foods: maida, refined / processed foods, junk foods are very sticky. They stick to the large intestine for long time, producing the toxins which get absorbed by the body. Result: filling the body with more toxins and blocking the way for flushing of metabolic waste.</p>
<p>6. Late night dinner: the digestive system can’t be fully active while we are sleeping, hence can not complete the task in the night. Bacteria in the gut thrive on the food, and by morning, except fats, other material is eaten by them, leaving lot of foul residues / by-products in the gut. As the digestive system is semi active, lungs and heart can not get sufficient relaxation during the sleep. It is tiring them day by day.</p>
<p>7. Impotent food grains: major part of our food is wheat or rice. They are now genetically modified and can not be used as seeds for next crop. (Terminator seeds). These grains can terminate our reproduction capacity in the long run.</p>
<p>(Already infertility problem was observed in cows which are fed with genetically modified cotton seeds)</p>
<p>Switch over to naturally grown local varieties.</p>
