<p>Author: Pallavi Marshal, Certified Yoga Trainer, Bodhi Yoga Academy</p>
<p><a href="https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-619 alignleft" src="https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-300x300.jpg 300w, https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-150x150.jpg 150w, https://bodhiyogainstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Third Trimester</strong></p>
<p>In this trimester with the growing baby inside, the body’s centre of gravity changes, so care should be taken, particularly for standing and balancing asanas, despite wall support.</p>
<p>Symptoms like heart burn, frequent urination, back pain and swelling in the limbs cause discomfort which continued practice of yoga can help alleviate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Relieving pressure from the back is essential so in place of Shavasana, lying on the side with bolster or supported Supta Badhkonasana are preferred for Yoga Nidra and rest.</li>
<li>Pelvic tilts and gentle spinal stretches should be performed for relaxing the back.</li>
<li>Vipritkarni with legs up on the wall helps relieving swollen legs and feet.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Sukha Prasava Mantra can be chanted throughout the pregnancy and during delivery:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">Mathru boodeshwara devo </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">Bakthanaam ishta thayaka </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">Sukanthi kunthala naavaha </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">Sukha Prasava Mrichchathuhuhu</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Meaning</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">Salutations to you, Oh goddess; </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">You are the mother of all gods; </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">You are the great goddess, who is always kind to your devotees, </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">I&#8217;m invoking you to please protect this lady, </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">Who is your devotee and who is constantly praying to you. </span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;">By your grace, please bless her with a beautiful baby and a safe delivery.</span></p>
<p><strong><u>Benefits </u></strong></p>
<p>The benefits of Yoga surpass the physical level and extend to the mental and spiritual level as well. Relaxed body and positive state of mind results in an overall healthy pregnancy where the mother is in tune with the changes in her body :</p>
<ul>
<li>Yogasanas provide the needed flexibility and strength to the right set of muscles required for child birth.</li>
<li>Hip openers and gentle supported back bends can help ease tension and prepare the body for delivery</li>
<li>Relaxation techniques like Yoga Nidra and Meditation are beneficial in keeping depression and anxiety away</li>
<li>Pranayama increases the <em>Prana</em> and is great for energizing the entire body</li>
<li>Breathing techniques practised during pregnancy are also helpful when in labour</li>
<li>Regular Yoga practice can result in mindful eating and healthy weight gain</li>
<li>Improvement in the quality of sleep</li>
<li>Prenatal yoga classes are a perfect time to connect with the baby and feel its movements</li>
<li>A Stress-free healthy pregnancy reduces the chances of complications during birth and thereafter</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Contraindications and Precautions </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doctor’s approval is essential before starting the practice as women with certain medical conditions and those with high risk pregnancies need to exercise caution</li>
<li>Expecting mothers should practice under the guidance of a certified yoga professional</li>
<li>Hot Yoga, Power Yoga and intense forms like Vinyasa are not recommended during pregnancy</li>
<li>Inversions, deep twists and backbends, Lying on the belly or flat on the back (second trimester onwards) are contraindicated</li>
<li>Asanas which put too much pressure on the abdomen (Boat Pose, Chaturangasana etc)</li>
<li>Kumbhaka (holding of breath) and Pranayamas which involve rapid breathing like Kapalbhati to be strictly avoided</li>
<li>Yoga should be practised in a well ventilated room</li>
<li>Staying cool and hydrated is crucial</li>
<li>Practising Yoga with awareness is fundamental but is particularly relevant to listen to the body during pregnancy</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article is written by Yoga Student, Netali Agarwal</p>
<p><strong>Is Health our Wealth??</strong></p>
<p>Every one of us is aware of the very old saying, ‘<strong>Health is Wealth’</strong>, but in today’s fast forward world, is really health considered to be our wealth? We don’t realize the importance of a healthy body until we get a set back in form of some or other health issues. Normally a healthy self is taken for granted. Everything else is more important than this most important wealth. Yet once we fall sick, it can’t be ignored and at that very moment, it gains all our focus and concern.</p>
<p>So let’s have a look at the prime and very basic factors to keep this wealth with us for life long.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulated lifestyle</li>
<li>Balanced diet</li>
<li>Regular exercise</li>
<li>Proper sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>These are 4 basic mantras to lead healthy and wealthy lifestyle. Most of these we are aware of and try to cope up also but what we majorly lack to follow is mantra# 3, <strong>Regular exercise</strong>. Exercise could be done in any form but the question comes here is; is it the right one that we are doing or it needs some guidance and modification?</p>
<p>We have very basic excuses for not able to follow a regular exercise pattern. I, myself think of skipping it at times to have an extra hour of sleep or to watch a movie. But then I realized that I do this because I take exercise a forced constraint on me. If I enjoy it, then it would be equivalent to an extra hour of sleep or watching a movie or chit chatting with my friends over coffee. So, without wasting much time let’s directly jump to the point. Anything is fun if it’s not much time taking and easy. <strong>YOGA </strong> is the best physical activity to get all these benefits with ease and within shorter time (as per once convenience). I will introduce a few basic yoga practices which will help you to lead a healthy life.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tadasana – Mountain Pose</li>
<li>Parshvasana – Side Stretch Pose</li>
<li>Surya Namaskar – Sun salutation</li>
<li>Vrikshasana – Tree Pose</li>
<li>Shalabhasana – Locust Pose</li>
<li>Bhujangasana – Cobra Pose</li>
<li>Dhanurasana – Bow Pose</li>
<li>Navasana – Boat Pose</li>
<li>Shavasana – Corpse Pose</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: All the above asanas will give best results when done under guidance.</p>
<p>Above asanas if practiced on regular basis, will definitely lead to righteous healthy and happy lifestyle.  I would like to end this article with a healthy quote –</p>
<p>“ Yoga began with the first person wanting to be healthy and happy all the time .”</p>
<h2>                                                                        – Sri Swami Satchidananda</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;">PCOD is not a disease  !</span></span></strong></h3>
<p>With the change in our lifestyle and increased stress levels, 1 in 10 women is diagnosed with PCOD. PCOD is short for Polycystic Ovary Disorder is a prevalent disorder in the women of reproductive age. The underlying cause of PCOD is a hormonal imbalance which occurs due to a variety of reasons like unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits, anxiety, stress, and depression. Women with this disorder have an irregular menstrual cycle and higher levels of male hormones “androgens” due to which it contributes to infertility. Due to higher levels of male hormones, these women can experience acne and excess hair growth on the upper lip, chin, and on the lower abdomen. PCOD can result in increased insulin resistance thereby leading to an increased risk of developing Type2 diabetes. Weight gain is one of the consequences of PCOD which leads to obesity. Unfortunately, women with this disorder also have great difficulty in losing weight.</p>
<h3><strong>Foods to be included in diet:</strong></h3>
<p>High fiber foods are highly recommended for women diagnosed with PCOD like, millets and multigrain flour.</p>
<p>Green leafy vegetables are a source of vitamins and rich in iron, calcium, potassium which contribute towards managing the symptoms of PCOD like improved thyroid functioning which is crucial for better hormone balance.</p>
<p>Colored vegetables and fruits are high in antioxidant and act against the harmful effects of stress.</p>
<p>Foods with high omega three fatty acids like nuts.</p>
<p>Goods with low Glycemic Index: High levels of sugar aggravate the condition and are a big “no-no.” Implement your diet with non-starchy vegetables, beans, sprouts, and lentils.</p>
<p><strong>Foods to avoid:</strong> Canned juices, sweetened drinks, sodas, starchy vegetables like potatoes, and corn. Refined sugar and processed foods like pasta, white bread, cookies, cakes, and potato chips.</p>
<h3><strong>Yoga: A remedy for PCOD</strong></h3>
<p>We know that yoga is a unified form of exercise which works on our whole body. From weight loss to stress handling, Yoga can keep our body and mind in shape. The following are some asanas which prove beneficial to cure or prevent PCOD:</p>
<p><strong>Baddha konasana</strong> (Bound Angle Pose): This asana stimulates abdomen, ovaries, bladder, and improves blood circulation in the lower abdomen organs. It gives relief from mild depression, anxiety, and irregular menstruation.</p>
<p><strong>Bhujangasana</strong> (Cobra pose): This asana improves and deepens breathing. It tones the ovaries and the uterus, helps in menstrual disorders, stimulates appetite, alleviates constipation, and is beneficial for all the abdominal organs.</p>
<p><strong>Naukasana</strong> (Boat pose): It strengthens the abdominal muscles and spine, stimulates thyroid gland and kidneys, thereby relieving stress and improving digestion.</p>
<p><strong>Ardha Matsyendra asana</strong> (Seated Half Spinal Twist): This asana is an answer for infertility as it massages and hence stimulates the lower abdomen organs and even decreases menstrual discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>Padmasana</strong> (Lotus pose): It stimulates organs in the abdomen, bladder and most importantly calms the brain. Its benefits included natural childbirth and decreased menstrual discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>Marjari pose</strong> (Cat stretch): This dynamic asana massages spine, belly, and internal organs and hence aids in digestion.</p>
<p><strong>Parsarita Padottanasana</strong> (Wide leg stretch with forwarding bend): It strengthens the spine, and tones the abdominal organs. Stimulates the blood circulation to the brain and hence calms the mind and relieves stress.</p>
<p><strong>Chakki Chalanasana</strong> (Churning the mill): This asana is excellent for toning the nerves and organs of the pelvis and abdomen. It is beneficial for regulating the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Nauka Sanchalanasana</strong> (Rowing the boat): It has a positive effect on the pelvis and abdomen and releases energy blockages in these areas. It is especially useful for gynecological disorders like PCOD and also removes constipation.</p>
<p><strong>Supta Udarakarshanasana</strong> (Sleeping abdominal stretch pose): This asana stretches the abdominal muscles and organs and hence improves digestion.</p>
<p><strong>Matsyasana</strong> (Fish pose): This asana stretches the intestines and abdominal organs and is useful for all intestinal disorders. It regulates the thyroid gland, and the blood circulation is diverted to the pelvic organs due to the pressure of the feet on the thighs.</p>
<p><strong>Shavasana</strong> (Corpse pose): It relaxes the complete body and calms the mind. It relieves stress and increases body awareness.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;">PCOD is not a disease that needs a cure but a disorder which requires a severe lifestyle change to get rid of it. A lifestyle which involves regular exercise and healthy eating can keep you away as well as can help you be freed from this terrible disorder. </span></h3>
