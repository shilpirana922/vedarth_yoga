				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><u>Yoga is for Joy</u></strong></p>
<p>Yoga is not against your joys. In fact, with yoga your joy increases manifold.</p>
<p>Coordination between <em>INDRIYAS</em> (Sense organs) and mind will improve tremendously with yoga. Glandular system functions perfectly with which bodily rhythms are maintained properly. Nervous system becomes very powerful, with which sensory organs will have peak performance.</p>
<p>Vigyana Bhairava Tantra gave many meditations on sensual pleasures including coitus.</p>
<p>Hatha Yoga Pradeepika gave techniques to increase genitals‚Äô strength and joy.</p>
<p>Combining these techniques with yoga (tailored to suit present time requirement), and, highly potent Ayurvedic massage and Ayurvedic medicinal help;</p>
<ul>
<li>issues related to <strong><em>sexual debility</em></strong> and <strong><em>sterility</em></strong> can be solved much easily and in much lesser time when compared to Infertility Clinics‚Äô. And the price is not even 1/10<sup>th</sup> of what you have to pay to those clinics, to have a baby.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chances to conceive are more than 10 times when compared to the actual results of Infertility Clinics.</p>
<p>The side effects of yoga are ‚Äì good health, stress free mind, heightened positive emotional state and <strong><em>greater joy in coitus</em></strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yoga &#8211; The Supreme Science</strong></span></em></p>
<p>Warning !!!¬† ¬†This series of articles are dedicated to Sincere Yoga Seekers ONLY !!!</p>
<p>Present life style of human is the root cause for many health issues. Majority of health issues are psychological and few are physical. Majority of people want to address physical aspect of their life. Hence, majority of people go to <a href="http://bodhiyogainstitute.com/"><em><strong>Yoga</strong> <strong>Studios</strong> </em></a>assuming that the YOGA helps them to reduce weight, stress levels. Interestingly Yoga Teachers also focus more on physical aspect of human.¬†Yoga is not an exercise. Some Yoga Teachers teach asanas or exercises in yoga studios and some teach advanced asanas or exercises in yoga studios.</p>
<p>Few yoga teachers know the secrets behind yoga ( Purpose of Yoga ), but they teach asanas or¬†exercises only to students because students are seeking knowledge about physical body only.</p>
<p>True seekers will get the ultimate <em><strong>Yogic Knowledge</strong></em> from the masters not from yoga teachers ( like me, Ashok Vankineni <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
<p>Origin of the Yoga starts from Patanjali Yoga Sutras (Yoga Scriptures point of view). Sage &#8220;<strong>Patanjali&#8221;¬†</strong>has not emphasized about physical body.¬† There is only line about Asana (Pose) ‚ÄúSukham Sthiram Asanam‚Äù. No one can find about any Asana (Pose) in Patanajali Yoga Sutras.</p>
<p>Yoga is a great asset for the whole world especially for the present generation. Yoga is a Science to know about mind, not to deal with physical aspect of human.</p>
<p>Many people are scared about <em><strong>Yoga Science</strong></em> by seeing the circus poses of Yoga Teachers <em><strong>standing on hands</strong></em>¬†(or) <em><strong>standing on one hand</strong></em>¬†(or) <em><strong>Keeping head on feet</strong></em>¬† etc.,</p>
<p>One must know that the &#8220;Science of Yoga&#8221; is integral part of Indian Culture and Civilization.</p>
<p>Modern World demands YOGA.</p>
<p>Now, everybody is believing that Yoga gives better Health and Stress Free Life because Medical Science accepts the Fact YOGA IS THE ONLY WAY &amp; ULTIMATE OPTION to have FREEDOM from Stress, Tensions &amp; Anxiety etc.,</p>
